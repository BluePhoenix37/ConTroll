# ConTroll
Simply put, ConTroll is a platformer to end boredom. It's kind of stupid, and not the best, but some people like it and that's all that matters.

Based off of the [Clarity game engine](https://github.com/dissimulate/Clarity), with multiple modifications and bug fixes. Currently hosted using the [glitch](https://glitch.com) website [here](https://con-troll.glitch.me)
